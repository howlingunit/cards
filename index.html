        <h2>A picture</h2>

        <p>Some say that this picture is the best taken and you know what maybe it is because in all truth I love this picture the soft colours mixed with the gentle slopes give a calming effect. With that said, the aspect ratio of this picture does leave a lot to be desired as it limits the possible applications of this beautiful photograph.</p>
        <p>On to more pressing matters, this is a second paragraph, and I need a lot of text to see what would happen if there was indeed a lot of text put on the screen you see. I know this is a massive change of subject from the picture, but sometimes we need to change what we look at to understand the big picture! </p>
